3 java files existed

- TEA.java : contains the implementation of TEA algorithms and CBC encryption and decryption
- testTEA.java: tests ECB mode by using TEA algorithms 
- testTEAcbc.java: tests CBC mode by using TEA algorithms



First, make sure to change the path of the image depending on where you put the imagein the java files (testTEA.java & testTEAcbc.java).

to Test ECB mode > open testTEA.java and run the code.

to Test CBC mode > open testTEAcbc.java and run the code.
