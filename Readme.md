## Tiny Encryption Algorithm

This project implements tiny encryption algorithms with in two cipher block mdoes: CBC mode and ECB mode. 

## Note 

You can use and .bmp image. The image I used in the test might not be clear in ECB mode because I converted it by an online tool.

## Tests

There are 2 test files: testCBCmode.java and testECBmode.java. To encrypt an image in either modes, make sure to change the path to the image in the source code, then compile and run the program.
Running the test files will create 2 images: one for encrypting the image, and the other for decrypting the image that was just encrypted.
